### TO-DO
- Swagger documentation
- Unique constraints on composite primary keys (when creating records)
- Remove available_copies when deleting an isbn
- Investigate why paystack doesn't accept float numbers as payment (or maybe its just my configuration)
- Docker
- Deploying to vercel (or any other free platform)

- Should add total_copies so that I can track the total copies and available copies (after borrowed)
- Add an image database to handle all the cover_images
